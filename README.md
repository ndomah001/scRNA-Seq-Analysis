# Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis
## ‚ùìWhat is scRNA-Seq
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis is a powerful technique that allows researchers to measure the gene expression of individual cells within a heterogeneous sample. Unlike bulk RNA sequencing, where gene expression is averaged across all cells, scRNA-seq captures the unique transcriptomic profiles of each cell. This provides insights into cellular diversity, rare cell types, developmental pathways, and responses to treatments at a single-cell resolution.

One of the most widely used tools for scRNA-seq analysis is the Seurat package in R. Seurat is designed to process, analyze, and visualize single-cell RNA-seq data. It offers an integrated pipeline for performing key steps in scRNA-seq analysis, such as normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Seurat has become an essential tool for biologists working with scRNA-seq, offering flexibility and robustness for both novice and advanced users in single-cell analysis.

A typical workflow looks something like this:
